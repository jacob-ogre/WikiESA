# WikiESA

[Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) is one of the most-used sites on the Internet, but the coverage of threatened and endangered species--and the Endangered Species Act that affords them protection--is severely lacking. We have a project, `WikiESA`, under way to address this gap.

## Templates

The first purpose of this repo is to hold some basic templates to start articles on ESA-listed species.
